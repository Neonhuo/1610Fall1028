//Somebody once told me
//The world was gonna roll me
//I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
//She was lookin' kinda dumb
//With her finger and her thumb
//In the shape
//Of an "L"
//On her forehead
//Well the years start comin'
//And they don't stop comin'
//Fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin'
//Didn't make sense not to live for fun
//Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
//So much to do, so much to see
//So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
//You'll never know if you don't go
//You'll never shine if you don't glow
//Hey now
//You're an all star
//Get your game on
//Go play
//Hey now
