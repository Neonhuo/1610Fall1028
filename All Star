//Somebody once told me
//The world was gonna roll me
//I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
//She was lookin' kinda dumb
//With her finger and her thumb
//In the shape
//Of an "L"
//On her forehead
//Well the years start comin'
//And they don't stop comin'
//Fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin'
//Didn't make sense not to live for fun
//Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
//So much to do, so much to see
//So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
//You'll never know if you don't go
//You'll never shine if you don't glow
//Hey now
//You're an all star
//Get your game on
//Go play
//Hey now
//You're a rock star
//Get your show on
//Get paid
//All that glitters is gold
//Only shooting stars
//Break the mold
//It's a cool place
//And they say it gets colder
//You're bundled up now
//Wait 'till you get older
//But the Meteor Men beg to differ
//Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
//The ice we skate
//Is getting pretty thin
//The water's getting warm
//So you might as well swim
//My world's on fire
//How 'bout yours?
//That's the way I like it
//And I never get bored
//Hey now
//You're an all star
//Get your game on
//Go play
//Hey now
//You're a rock star
//Get your show on
